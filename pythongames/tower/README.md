# ABOUT 
## Tower is a strategy game subgenre in which the goal is to defend a player's territory or possessions by obstructing enemy attackers or preventing enemies from reaching exits, which is usually accomplished by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack.
# How to play 
## To build a firm and secure base (in order to get a reasonably lengthy game) start with two blocks next to each other and create one block-width gap between them. Then place two more blocks on top in the same manner but at right-angles facing the other way. That way you have created a more solid base to play the game from - We wouldn't recommend trying to move any of these four pieces during the game!!

The picture at the top shows versions of the giant game being played - you can see the gap between the two blocks at the bottom as described.

All you need to do then is line 3 of the wooden blocks up next to each other on top of the second row of two blocks in the opposite direction, then take another three and align them next to each other at right angles to the first layer of three blocks.

The pictures of the towers will give you a better idea of what we mean by this. The blocks alternate until you have used up all 58 blocks. To make it easier to play, it is recommended that you make sure all the blocks are straight - so no pieces are sticking out at the start.

The Hi Tower pieces should be evenly spaced along the length of one block. This will leave gaps in between the blocks (as seen in the right-hand picture below) but will also give it a wider base - allowing for a longer and higher game!

The Giant Tower and Mega Hi Tower games should be aligned with no gaps in between the rows of three.
